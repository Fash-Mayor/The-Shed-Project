Title: Day 1: The Shed Project - PDF to Audio Converter Done!
Body:
"The Shed Project" starts strong with my first finished tool: a PDF-to-audio converter! This app lets you pick a PDF and hear it read aloud—great for hands-free learning. Built it with Kivy while leveling up my Python skills.  
What I Learned: Kivy’s event handling (binding buttons) and integrating external libs like PyPDF2 and pyttsx3 were the big wins. Syncing UI with backend logic was tricky but rewarding.  
How I Achieved It: Used a FileChooserListView for picking PDFs and a button to trigger conversion. Here’s the key part:  
python

from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout
from kivy.uix.filechooser import FileChooserListView
from kivy.uix.button import Button
import PyPDF2
import pyttsx3

class PdfAudioApp(App):
    def build(self):
        layout = BoxLayout(orientation='vertical')
        self.file_chooser = FileChooserListView(filters=['*.pdf'])
        self.convert_btn = Button(text='Play Audio', on_press=self.convert)
        layout.add_widget(self.file_chooser)
        layout.add_widget(self.convert_btn)
        return layout

    def convert(self, instance):
        pdf_path = self.file_chooser.selection[0]
        pdf = PyPDF2.PdfReader(open(pdf_path, 'rb'))
        text = ''.join(page.extract_text() for page in pdf.pages)
        engine = pyttsx3.init()
        engine.say(text)
        engine.runAndWait()

PdfAudioApp().run()

Result: It works! Select a PDF, hit "Play Audio," and it reads the whole doc aloud. Simple but powerful.  
Next Steps: Day 2, I’ll tackle a new tool—maybe a note-taking app. Suggestions welcome!  
Tips
If you hit specific hurdles (e.g., PDF text extraction issues or Kivy crashes), mention them briefly in "What I Learned" to show the grind.

Share it on X with #Kivy #Python #TheShedProject—people love seeing finished projects!

If you’ve got a unique feature (like voice selection or speed control), flaunt it in the "Result."

What do you think? Want to tweak anything or add a personal touch? And what’s your next app idea for Day 2?
